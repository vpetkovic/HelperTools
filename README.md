# Introduction 
I have bunch of helpers scattered around over the course of several years that I on regular basis by just grabbing relevant one(s)
from other projects or I just type it in each time. Yes, I know, I failed DRY principle. 
I finally decided to create new solution, that will unify all those helpers and organize them into class libraries and NuGet packages.

Fell free to reuse, extend and improve any. ðŸ¤˜
